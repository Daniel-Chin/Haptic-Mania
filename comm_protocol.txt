Arduino is requester, python is responder. 

After a note, if the next note is >`PREP_TIME=50ms` after, arduino requests. 

About byte range:
  Range is [1, 127] because 
    < 128 for Serial limitations, 
    != 0 for null terminated string shenanigans. 

encodeTime: int -> str[3]

ardu -> py:
  'r'
    request.

py -> ardu: 
  '!'
    restart.
  'n' + note_time + note_position
    One note. 
    note_time: str = encodeTime(note_time: int)
    note_position: char = '0' + note_position: int
    // we don't need on/off info, since it's toggle. 
  'e'
    end of song.
